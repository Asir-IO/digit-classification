## About the project 
-This project uses a neural network model (mlp) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and gradio interface.

-It includes data preprocessing, model training, and targeted data augmentation to improve performance on frequently misclassified digits.

-The final model delivers high accuracy and is optimized for real-world digit recognition, with an interactive Gradio app providing a user-friendly interface.

 ## Built With
- Python 3.13  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- tensorflow
- Gradio app

## prerequisites 
Ensure you have:

-python 3.13 

-pip 

-Gradio 5.39.0

## Installation 
1. clone the repository:
2. Create and activate a virtual enviroment
3. install requirements from (requirements.txt)
4. launch the gradio app
